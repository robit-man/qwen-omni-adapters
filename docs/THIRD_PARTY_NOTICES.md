## Portal QR encoder

The phone-sharing modal bundles the QRCode for JavaScript encoder by Kazuhiko
Arase (copyright 2009) under the MIT License. Its license is distributed next
to the browser bundle as `portal/static/qr_code.LICENSE.txt`. Encoding happens
entirely in the browser; the portal URL and access fragment are not sent to a
QR-code service.
