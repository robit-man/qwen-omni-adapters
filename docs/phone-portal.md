# Phone Portal Deployment Runbook

The Robit Omni Phone Portal provides a temporary HTTPS endpoint for testing the
published model from iOS or Android. Its source and complete usage guide live
in [`portal/`](../portal/README.md).

## Deployment topology

```text

Omni phone portal :8920
  │ authenticated, fixed-model proxy
  ▼
Omni adapter :8910
  ├── Qwen3-Omni comprehension :8901  (broker-scoped CUDA, persistent)
  ├── Ollama language :11434           (broker-owned lanes)
  └── Qwen3-TTS :8892                  (broker-coordinated CUDA, single-shot)
```

The portal remains externally pinned to the combined Omni tag. Its language
stage uses the equivalent E03 core Ollama tag through `OMNI_LANGUAGE_MODEL` so
the broker sizes only the base/projector layers; startup verifies that both tags
reference the same standard blobs. This avoids counting the combined tag's custom 38.8 GB
media sidecar a second time after those media views are already loaded by the
scoped workers.

No component port listens on a public interface. The public URL is a temporary
capability URL; possession of its fragment grants portal access for that
session.

## Readiness gate

Before the tunnel is published, the supervisor requires:

- valid sidecar resolution for the requested Ollama tag;
- four complete materialized component views;
- successful CUDA broker discovery, scoped lease acquisition, and verified
  comprehension residency on the assigned UUID;
- HTTP 2xx health from comprehension, TTS, adapter, portal, and Ollama;
- exact `PORTAL TEXT OK` language sentinel and valid GPU-generated TTS WAV
  through the authenticated portal.

Any failed gate terminates the children, releases the scoped lease, and removes
only the portal-owned cache. The tunnel is never started after a failed local
gate.

## Start, inspect, and stop

```bash
./deploy.sh
portal/start.sh --status
tail -f runtime-data/logs/supervisor.log
portal/start.sh --stop
```

The printed URL must be opened as-is so its `#access=...` fragment reaches the
browser. Microphone permission requires the HTTPS endpoint. Hold the microphone
icon while speaking; release it to create a playable WAV attachment, then send.
The speaker icon switches between text-only and text-plus-TTS replies. The
waveform button opens Qwen3-TTS voice cloning and sampling controls. The phone
icon starts automatic voice turns. Local VAD calibrates ambient noise for 900
ms, requires 220 ms of sustained activity above an adaptive threshold, and
closes after 750 ms of silence. Quiet, clicks, and elevated steady noise do not
call remote ASR. The green waveform is translucent while inactive and opaque
only during confirmed activity. The microphone remains active for barge-in;
sustained speech uses a stricter threshold, cancels playback, and queues the
interruption. Portable adapter v1 remains `stream:false`;
`/api/chat/stream` is an authenticated portal extension with stage, text,
thinking, PCM, and one authoritative final adapter event.

Qwen3-TTS uses four codec frames per streaming decoder window by default,
approximately 320 ms for the packaged 12 Hz model. The browser schedules the
first received PCM with a 10 ms floor and queues later chunks on the Web Audio
timeline. The final response retains a complete replayable WAV even when live
PCM playback succeeded.

The camera icon captures device video and microphone audio with a live preview
inside the composer. Tap again or send to finalize a 30-second-maximum MP4/WebM
attachment. The model receives the complete bounded turn; adapter v1 does not
continuously ingest an open camera stream.

Re-recording replaces the previous unsent camera capture. The exact submitted
blob remains visible as a muted looping thumbnail in the user turn. Each media
submission sends only its current media bytes and starts a new media context;
prior media and generated descriptions are not replayed. The adapter also sets
`cache_prompt:false` on the llama.cpp comprehension request. This is mandatory:
multimodal prompt-slot reuse can otherwise answer a new clip from the previous
clip's decoded embeddings.

Assistant responses render a DOM-built safe Markdown subset. The composer clears
as soon as send accepts a request, its focus border remains neutral, and the
locked mobile viewport prevents focus/pinch zoom. Page content is not
selectable and does not expose iOS touch callouts; text entry fields retain
normal cursor and editing behavior.

Reasoning defaults off. The portal always sends a boolean Ollama `think` field:
`false` until the brain control is explicitly enabled, then `true`. Native
`message.thinking` deltas and fallback `<think>` blocks are separated into the
collapsed reasoning view only while enabled. No reasoning-control system prompt
or `/no_think` suffix is injected. Tagged-output sanitation is only a
fail-closed display/TTS guard.

## Multi-user isolation and diagnostics

The default portal admits four simultaneous HTTP requests and serializes them
through one GPU inference lane. The number beside **ONLINE** counts distinct
browser sessions with active or queued work. Request bodies, streams, media,
voice overrides, tool rounds, and responses remain request-local. Conversation
history exists only in each browser page; the server has no shared conversation
or media history to bleed into another user.

A Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie provides an opaque partition key for
the aggregate count and ephemeral diagnostics. `/api/activity` exposes only
aggregate queue counts. `GET /api/diagnostics` returns only the caller's timing
journal; `POST /api/diagnostics` accepts the browser's content-redacted stream
milestones; `DELETE /api/diagnostics` deletes only that journal. All require the
same bearer token as inference.

Diagnostic events may contain a request ID, modality flags, status,
queue/transport time, first text, TTS-stage, first PCM, and completion timing.
They never contain prompt/reply text, transcripts, thinking, audio, frames,
waveforms, tokens, IP addresses, or user-agent strings. Journals use hashed
filenames under `OMNI_PORTAL_SESSION_LOG_DIR`, expire five minutes after the
last heartbeat, and are purged at portal startup/shutdown. The trash control
aborts active page work, stops playback/call capture, clears browser history,
and deletes its journal immediately. Late events from the aborted request are
rejected; a later new request creates a fresh journal.

## Voice stability

The stack's speech weights are Qwen3-TTS 12 Hz 1.7B Base. Without a speaker
reference, `seed: -1` allows voice/timbre changes between requests. The portal's
default profile pins seed `42` and the checked-in, metadata-free
`portal/voices/default_voice.wav` reference. To override it,
record or upload a clean WAV in the header voice panel, set another trusted
server-local `speaker_file` in `portal/voice-profile.json`, or
point `OMNI_VOICE_PROFILE` to another profile. Browser references are
validated, materialized only for the generation, and deleted afterward; the
browser cannot choose a server path.
See the portal README for sampling fields and the distinction between Base
speaker-embedding cloning and separate VoiceDesign/CustomVoice checkpoints.

## Verification matrix

| Check | Expected result |
|---|---|
| `/healthz` through tunnel | HTTP 200 without internal details |
| `/api/status` without bearer | HTTP 401 |
| `/api/status` with bearer | all four stages `ok=true` |
| Text | exact sentinel |
| Microphone/WAV | non-empty transcription or chat response |
| Device camera | live preview, bounded MP4/WebM attachment, video comprehension |
| Speaker + microphone | transcription followed by valid spoken audio |
| Call control | silence-delimited audio turn followed by automatic playback |
| VAD noise rejection | quiet/click/steady-noise fixtures create zero remote requests; sustained events create one |
| Voice clone | recorded/uploaded WAV changes speaker timbre and remains replayable |
| Image | non-empty visual description |
| Video with audio | ordered visual description plus spoken content |
| Sequential video isolation | red → blue → red clips describe red → blue → red; `cache_prompt=false` |
| TTS | valid 24 kHz mono PCM16 WAV playable on phone |
| TTS first PCM | four-frame window and browser first-audio milestone recorded |
| Concurrent sessions | two users show active/queued counts and receive only their own marker |
| Diagnostic lifecycle | journals are session-isolated; trash deletes immediately; idle data expires in 300 s |
| CUDA scope | comprehension and each TTS process resident on reserved UUID |

Use `portal/smoke.py` for the machine-verifiable form of these
checks. Browser microphone/camera permission and phone speaker output require a
manual device check.

## Rollback

For this temporary deployment, rollback is shutdown:

```bash
portal/start.sh --stop
```

This removes external ingress first, then stops local HTTP services and the
broker-scoped worker. The Ollama model/tag and sidecar blob are retained. The
portal-owned materialized cache is removed unless `OMNI_KEEP_CACHE=1` was set.
Per-session diagnostic JSON is removed on shutdown regardless of component
cache retention.
