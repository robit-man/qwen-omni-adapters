# Robit Omni Phone Portal

This example is a phone-first web client for
`robit/qwen3.8-27b-e03-obliterated-omni:q4km`. It exposes the existing Omni
adapter through one authenticated HTTPS origin and keeps Ollama,
Qwen3-Omni comprehension, and Qwen3-TTS bound to loopback.

The interface borrows the visual language of the
[NOCLIP documentation](https://noclip.org/docs): black grid background,
compact monospace type, yellow accents, thin borders, fixed runtime status,
and a responsive control rail. It does not copy NOCLIP assets or documentation
content.

## Interface and routing

The phone UI is deliberately a single chat surface. Press and hold the
microphone icon to record; the live waveform disappears on release and the
resulting 16 kHz WAV appears as a playable attachment before it is sent. The
paperclip accepts WAV, JPEG, PNG, WebP, MP4, and WebM. The speaker icon is the
only output toggle: gray requests text only, while yellow requests both text
and synthesized audio. Assistant text renders a safe Markdown subset including
headings, emphasis, lists, block quotes, links, and fenced code. Sending a turn
clears the composer and attachments immediately.

An audio attachment sent without typed text is a conversational turn, not a
direct-ASR result. The portal briefly shows `Audio clip`, replaces that text in
the originating user bubble with only the adapter's tagged verbatim
`input_transcript`, and sends the separated transcript plus non-speech acoustic
evidence through Qwen3.8. Only Qwen3.8's answer appears in the assistant bubble.
Clients that need transcription without a language reply can still call the
adapter explicitly with `omni.task="transcribe"`.

The brain icon controls the real Ollama `think` request field. Gray is the
default and sends the boolean `think:false`; violet explicitly sends
`think:true`. No system instruction, prompt suffix, or synthetic `/no_think`
message controls this mode. When enabled, streamed reasoning is shown in a
collapsed Reasoning disclosure beneath the answer instead of being mixed into
the visible response. The adapter preserves Ollama's native
`message.thinking` channel and also separates malformed fallback
`<think>...</think>` output, including tags split across stream chunks. The
latter is a fail-closed output guard, not the reasoning control. Reasoning is
never sent to TTS.

The camera icon in the upper-right control group opens the device camera and microphone with a live, muted
in-interface preview. Tap it again—or press Send—to stop and attach the bounded
recording as MP4 or WebM, including its audio track when the browser provides
one. Recordings use a constrained video bitrate to remain below the portal
upload limit. Starting Call while the camera is active pauses the attachment
recording and sends the current visual frame with each detected speech turn;
this provides bounded live visual conversation without presenting an unbounded
video stream to the model context.

The phone icon at the upper right starts hands-free voice mode. Browser-side
voice activity detection first calibrates ambient noise for 900 ms, requires
220 ms of sustained activity above an adaptive threshold, and closes an
utterance after 750 ms of silence. It submits a 16 kHz WAV only after that
confirmed utterance; quiet, transient clicks, and elevated steady room noise do
not call remote ASR. The waveform border, line, and label remain translucent
while inactive and become opaque only while VAD is active. Confirmed speech is
sent through Qwen3-Omni and Qwen3.8, response text is relayed as Ollama produces
it, and Qwen3-TTS speech is streamed back.
The microphone remains active during inference and playback. Sustained speech
stops current playback, records the interruption, and queues the new turn as
soon as the in-flight generation releases the serial inference lane. Echo
cancellation and a higher interruption threshold reduce self-triggering. The
live waveform and status line show whether the portal is listening,
understanding, preparing speech, speaking, or handling an interruption.
Tap the phone icon again to stop capture, abort an in-flight request, and stop
playback.

| Composer action | Adapter route |
|---|---|
| Text chat | Qwen3.8 language |
| Audio attachment with no prompt | Qwen3-Omni transcript/acoustic evidence → Qwen3.8 reply |
| Audio attachment with a prompt | Qwen3-Omni comprehension → Qwen3.8 |
| Image/video with no prompt | Qwen3-Omni direct description |
| Image/video with a prompt | Qwen3-Omni comprehension → Qwen3.8 |
| Device camera capture | live local preview → MP4/WebM turn → video comprehension |
| Camera + phone icons | current visual frame + repeated speech turns → spoken replies |
| Speaker icon enabled | final text → streamed Qwen3-TTS PCM → replayable 24 kHz WAV |
| Brain icon enabled | Ollama `think:true` → collapsible streamed reasoning |
| Phone icon enabled | repeated/barge-in audio → comprehension → streamed Qwen3.8 text → TTS |

Microphone capture is encoded in the browser as a complete 16 kHz mono PCM16
WAV. `/api/chat/stream` is a portal extension that relays NDJSON stage events,
Ollama text/reasoning deltas, and one authoritative final response. It does not
change the portable adapter v1 contract, whose `/api/chat` route still requires
`stream:false`. Generated speech arrives as base64-tagged PCM16 deltas and is
scheduled directly into the browser's unlocked Web Audio context. The final
event also carries the complete tagged 24 kHz mono PCM16 WAV for replay and
adapter compatibility. The browser remains receptive to barge-in throughout
generation and scheduled playback. The viewport disables focus and pinch zoom
for a stable app-like mobile layout. Conversation text and decorative content
also disable touch/mouse selection and iOS callouts; normal editing remains
enabled in the composer and voice configuration fields.

New user and assistant messages smoothly scroll the conversation to the newest
turn. The small number beside **ONLINE** reports distinct browser sessions with
an active or queued inference request; it is an aggregate only and is never
used as conversation state.

Video is sampled at 24 frames by the phone and clamped to at most 32 frames and
2 fps by the adapter. The comprehension GGUF declares a 65,536-token context,
and the deployment now starts `llama-server` at that native limit instead of
the former 8,192-token test setting. If a multimodal prompt still exceeds the
available context, the adapter retries only the comprehension stage with
progressively smaller frame caps (24/16/8/4/1 as applicable). A recorded video
turn therefore retains temporal comprehension whenever it fits; camera-call
mode uses one current frame per speech turn for lower latency.

Every comprehension request explicitly sets llama.cpp `cache_prompt:false`.
Prompt-slot reuse is safe for ordinary token prefixes but the pinned
multimodal worker can otherwise retain a previous clip's decoded embeddings.
The regression gate submits red → blue → red videos and requires red → blue →
red answers. Do not remove this setting as a performance optimization.

## Voice configuration and cloning

The TTS weights are Qwen3-TTS 12 Hz 1.7B Base, not LuxTTS. Tap the waveform
button in the portal header to open the request-local voice panel. It provides:

- a voice-clone toggle;
- phone recording or WAV upload for a clean 3–10 second reference;
- in-browser reference playback and removal;
- language, temperature, top-p, top-k, seed, and maximum-frame controls.

The reference is sent as a bounded base64 WAV envelope. The portal validates
its container, duration (0.5–30 seconds), and 10 MiB decoded limit, then the TTS
worker writes it into a per-generation temporary directory for `llama-tts`.
The file is deleted as soon as that generation finishes. The browser cannot
select a server path. Only clone a voice you own or have permission to use.

The repository ships [`voices/default_voice.wav`](voices/default_voice.wav) as
the active default reference. It is a 13.009-second, 16 kHz mono PCM16 WAV
rewritten without INFO, encoder, or other metadata chunks. The default profile
uses that file until the voice panel records or uploads a request-local
override.

Edit
[`voice-profile.json`](voice-profile.json) before startup to pin the server-side
defaults or a trusted server-local reference used by manual spoken replies and
call mode:

```json
{
  "schema": "robit.omni.voice-profile.v1",
  "name": "studio-voice",
  "language": "en",
  "speaker_file": "voices/studio-reference.wav",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "top_k": 40,
  "top_p": 0.9,
  "seed": 42,
  "max_frames": 512
}
```

The portable contract is
[`voice-profile-v1.schema.json`](../docs/schema/voice-profile-v1.schema.json).

`speaker_file` may be an absolute path or a path relative to the profile.
Qwen3-TTS accepts WAV or MP3 server references; the browser path deliberately
accepts WAV only. Use a clean, single-speaker clip without music or
reverberation. A fixed non-negative `seed` makes repeated turns reproducible.
`seed: -1` deliberately restores randomized voices and prosody. Lower
temperature/top-p/top-k generally improves consistency; higher values add
variation and can reintroduce timbre drift. Supported language codes are `zh`,
`en`, `de`, `it`, `pt`, `es`, `ja`, `ko`, `fr`, and `ru`.

The current llama.cpp interface for the Base checkpoint extracts a speaker
embedding from reference audio (`--tts-speaker-file`). It does not yet expose
the official Python stack's higher-fidelity `ref_audio + ref_text` in-context
clone path. It also has no separate natural-language style-instruction input.
Do not prepend style directions to spoken text: the model may read them aloud.
The official [Qwen3-TTS repository](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS)
documents VoiceDesign and CustomVoice capabilities, but those are separate
checkpoint/runtime paths; controls for them are not presented as if they were
present in this Base GGUF. Use a dedicated reference clip for the intended
timbre, accent, and delivery today.

Select another profile without editing the default:

```bash
OMNI_VOICE_PROFILE=/srv/voices/production.json \
  portal/start.sh --daemon
```

The portal validates the profile at startup, rejects direct client `speech`
paths, and applies only the bounded `portal_voice` controls from its own UI.
`/api/status` reports safe defaults and whether a server reference is active
without exposing its filesystem path.

## One-command deployment

From the repository root:

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

The command:

1. verifies the installed Ollama tag and sidecar;
2. reconstructs the four disposable media-runtime views when missing;
3. runs `docker gpu discover` and selects an unclaimed broker-approved GPU;
4. acquires one scoped 45 GiB lease and starts comprehension on that exact UUID;
5. starts broker-coordinated CUDA TTS, the unified adapter, and portal;
6. runs local status, exact-text, and GPU TTS smoke gates;
7. starts a Cloudflare Quick Tunnel and prints an HTTPS URL containing the
   access token in its URL fragment.

The URL has this form:

```text
https://random-words.trycloudflare.com/#access=HIGH_ENTROPY_TOKEN
```

Fragments are not sent in HTTP requests or referrer headers. The browser keeps
the token in session storage and sends it as an `Authorization: Bearer` header
only to same-origin `/api/*` routes. Do not publish the complete access URL.

Manage the deployment:

```bash
portal/start.sh --status
portal/start.sh --stop
```

Runtime state and logs default to
`runtime-data`. The supervisor owns all child
PIDs. On stop it drains the tunnel, portal, adapter, TTS wrapper, and
comprehension worker in that order. It then removes only a component cache
carrying its ownership marker. Set `OMNI_KEEP_CACHE=1` to keep the reconstructed
views for a near-term restart.

## CUDA-only media policy

The phone deployment has no CPU inference fallback. Persistent comprehension
uses `-ngl 99` on the exact GPU UUID assigned by a manual scoped broker lease.
TTS uses `--gpu-layers -1` on the same UUID. Because the current `llama-tts`
binary is single-shot, the wrapper calls broker `prepare` before every load,
waits until the TTS PID is visible as resident on that UUID, and then calls
`ready`. A failed reservation or residency check aborts deployment or the
request instead of silently running inference on CPU. Ollama language requests
continue through broker-owned GPU lanes.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `OMNI_MODEL` | release `q4km` tag | Pinned portal model |
| `OMNI_LANGUAGE_MODEL` | E03 core `27b` tag | Equivalent base/projector tag used to avoid loading the custom sidecar twice |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_RUNTIME_ROOT` | `runtime-data` | State/cache/log root |
| `OMNI_COMPREHENSION_GPU_UUID` | broker-selected | Explicit approved GPU override |
| `OMNI_COMPREHENSION_VRAM_MIB` | `45000` | Shared comprehension/TTS scoped reservation |
| `OMNI_COMPREHENSION_CONTEXT_TOKENS` | `65536` | Native comprehension worker context; propagated to the adapter |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_TOKEN` | generated | At least 24 characters |
| `OMNI_VOICE_PROFILE` | `portal/voice-profile.json` | Validated server-side Qwen3-TTS profile |
| `OMNI_TTS_STREAM_FRAMES` | `4` | Codec frames per live PCM decode window; four is about 320 ms and lowers first-audio latency |
| `OMNI_TTS_BROKER_TRANSITION_TIMEOUT_S` | `330` | Maximum wait for scoped prepare/ready transitions |
| `OMNI_KEEP_CACHE` | `0` | Keep materialized views after stop |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | 96 MiB | Same-origin JSON request cap |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_INFERENCE_SLOTS` | `1` | Simultaneous upstream inference lanes; keep at one for the shared single-lane GPU stack |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_MAX_INFLIGHT_REQUESTS` | `4` | Active plus queued portal requests before a bounded 503 response |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_SESSION_LOG_DIR` | runtime `session-logs` | Content-redacted, per-session timing journals |
| `OMNI_PORTAL_SESSION_LOG_TTL_S` | `300` | Inactive-session diagnostic retention; five minutes by default |

Ports `8901`, `8892`, `8910`, and `8920` are loopback-only. The Cloudflare
metrics endpoint defaults to loopback port `49312`.

## Full smoke test

The startup gate performs health checks, a text sentinel, and a GPU TTS
generation before publishing ingress. Run every media route against a live
deployment with:

```bash
TOKEN_FILE=runtime-data/state/access-token.txt

.venv/bin/python portal/smoke.py \
  --endpoint http://127.0.0.1:8920 \
  --token-file "$TOKEN_FILE" \
  --model robit/qwen3.8-27b-e03-obliterated-omni:q4km \
  --text --tool --tts \
  --audio ./speech-16khz-mono.wav \
  --image ./image.png \
  --video ./video.mp4
```

The smoke runner verifies non-empty media responses, exact text sentinel,
allow-listed tool completion, the direct ASR-to-TTS path when `--audio` and
`--tts` are combined, and the 24 kHz mono PCM16 TTS contract. It never prints
media base64 or the access token.

## Security boundary

- Only the portal is tunneled; Ollama and all workers remain on loopback.
- Every inference/status API requires a constant-time bearer-token match.
- The model tag is fixed server-side. Portable `/api/chat` rejects streaming;
  authenticated `/api/chat/stream` relays the bounded portal NDJSON extension.
- Media inference has no CPU fallback; CUDA residency is verified before the
  scoped lease is marked ready.
- The default admits four simultaneous portal requests and serializes them
  through one GPU inference lane. Queue tickets, request payloads, upstream
  responses, streaming iterators, voice settings, and tool rounds are
  request-local.
- Conversation history is browser-page-local. The portal stores no message,
  media, observation, KV-cache, or generated response as server-side session
  state, so one user's content cannot become another user's context.
- A random, Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookie partitions the aggregate
  activity count and ephemeral diagnostic journal. It is never supplied to a
  model or used to recover conversation context. `/api/activity` exposes only
  aggregate counts and requires the same bearer token as inference.
- Per-session diagnostics contain request IDs, modality flags, queue/transport
  timings, status codes, and browser milestones such as first text and first
  PCM. They never contain prompts, replies, transcripts, thinking, media,
  waveforms, bearer tokens, IP addresses, or user-agent strings. Journals are
  stored under hashed filenames, are inaccessible across browser sessions, and
  are purged five minutes after the session heartbeat stops.
- The trash button aborts the page's active request/call, stops playback,
  clears browser conversation state, and deletes that session's diagnostic
  journal immediately. A late completion from the aborted request cannot
  recreate the deleted journal; a genuinely new request starts a new one.
- Encoded JSON is limited to 96 MiB.
- The browser caps decoded image, video, and audio sizes below adapter limits.
- CSP, frame denial, no-referrer, no-store, and same-origin camera/microphone
  policies are applied.
- Tool execution is limited to `get_current_time` and
  `get_portal_capabilities`; unknown names return an error result and cannot
  execute programs, access files, or make network requests.
- Media observations remain untrusted evidence at the adapter boundary.
- During audio-only sends and calls, only the adapter's tagged
  `input_transcript` is rendered in the user bubble. Raw perception output is
  never attributed to the user, and the pending assistant card remains hidden
  until an assistant delta is available.
- Re-recording with the camera replaces the prior unsent camera clip, so only
  the latest captured segment enters a request. The exact submitted clip is
  retained as a muted looping video thumbnail on its user message; separately
  uploaded video attachments remain additive.
- Every new media submission starts an isolated model context. Earlier media
  bytes and their generated descriptions are excluded, while the successful
  newest media turn becomes the context for subsequent text-only follow-ups.
  Visual-call turns likewise use only the current frame; audio-only calls keep
  their conversational history.
- Every chat audio attachment performs combined ASR and environmental sound
  analysis. Speech is exposed separately from non-speech events, ambience,
  music, speaker activity, and temporal changes, so acoustic observations reach
  the language model without appearing as user-authored transcript text. For an
  unprompted clip, the tagged speech transcript replaces the temporary user
  placeholder and the language-model answer remains a separate assistant turn.

Cloudflare Quick Tunnels are temporary development endpoints, not durable
production ingress. Stop the portal after the phone test. For a persistent
deployment, replace the quick tunnel with a named tunnel plus Cloudflare
Access while retaining the portal bearer token.
